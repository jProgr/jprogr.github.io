## Tupe-kavalo an si-viro senjore

Tupe-kavalo de-i en karo via jalan ke i de go a lado de monte, ven subita si-viro i de deside eleti o tupe a si-viro jalan. Tupe-kavalo i de kan mira a si-viro animale-sela en pedi de monte an, go si-viro, da ma rapi jalan de-i apara a supa limi de da ma nea raka. Jusa ante si-viro i de jumpa, si-viro senjore i de kapa a si-viro e via si-viro koda an i de tenta tira, pero nulo-benda tupe-kavalo i da no sumete an i de tira kon ale si-viro poten.

"Bon," de-i dire de si-viro senjore, "i go a tu jalan, tu e nulo-benda bete, an i mira a ve da i lida a tu."

Kon da, si-viro i de libera, an sili tupe-kavalo i de jira-unda-go via lado de monte.

Man, ke i no ia a rason an i go o nulo-benda a si-ale o ego jalan ke i anti a amigo direto de man ke e ma saje sama si-ale, e en jalan go mala-pasa.

## The ass and his driver

An Ass was being driven along a road leading down the mountain side, when he suddenly took it into his silly head to choose his own path. He could see his stall at the foot of the mountain, and to him the quickest way down seemed to be over the edge of the nearest cliff. Just as he was about to leap over, his master caught him by the tail and tried to pull him back, but the stubborn Ass would not yield and pulled with all his might.

"Very well," said his master, "go your way, you willful beast, and see where it leads you."

With that he let go, and the foolish Ass tumbled head over heels down the mountain side.

They who will not listen to reason but stubbornly go their own way against the friendly advice of those who are wiser than they, are on the road to misfortune.
