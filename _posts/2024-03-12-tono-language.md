Every word is stressed on the second to last syllable. Compounds are stressed on the last syllable.

## Sentences

The order is subject, verb, object (SVO). Let's see a simple example:

- leno kuhan kuha - Leno eats food.

Every word works as any type, the type is determined by the position in the sentence and a suffix. Verbs are marked by the suffix "n"; "kuhan" means to eat. Before the verb we have a subject which is a noun or something that works like one; in this case the name Leno. "kuha" after the verb is the object, which is a noun or something that works like a noun: "kuha" means food.

## Context and mood

The word "leka" introduces context and mood. This is the Tono way to add more info to a sentence:

- leka nuyu, Tom kuha - Tom eats quickly.

The word leka followed by another word sets the mood of the following sentences. This can be at the start or end of the sentence, but it should always be split from the main sentence with a comma (,).

In the specific case of adverbs that modify the verb, they can be before the verb:

- Tom, leka nuyu, kuha - Tom eats quickly.

Do prefer using leka at the start of the sentence.

### Verbs

Verbs are denoted by the "n" suffix. Tense and aspect is set by using "leka" and one or more words. If the tense has been set in a previous sentence, it does not need to be set in a future sentence if it matches. For example:

- leka devo, leno kuha. leno kuha talu - Leno ate. Leno ate fruit.

The second sentence is also in the past with just one usage of "leka" in the first sentence. Optionally, for emphasis you may set the tense in every sentence.

#### Simple tenses

Do feel free to simplify tenses if coming from another language.

Simple present:
- leka yole, leno kuhan talu - Leno eats fruit.

Present progressive:
- leka duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno is eating fruit. 

Simple past:
- leka devo, leno kuhan talu - Leno ate fruit.

Future:
- leka vano, leno kuhan talu - Leno will eat fruit.

Imperative:
- leka pufe, leno kuhan talu - Leno, eat fruit.

#### More complex tenses

In general, prefer using simple tenses. But if needed, you may use the more complex versions.

Past progressive:
- leka devo duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno was eating fruit.

Present perfect simple:
- leka yole dopo, leno kuhan talu - Leno has eaten fruit.

Present perfect progressive:
- leka yole duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno has been eating fruit.

Past perfect simple:
- leka devo dopo, leno kuhan talu - Leno had eaten fruit.

Past perfect progressive:
- leka devo dopo duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno had been eating fruit.

Future progressive:
- leka vano duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno will be eating fruit.

Future perfect simple:
- leka vano dopo, leno kuhan talu - Leno will have eaten fruit.

Future perfect progressive:
- leka vano dopo duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno will have been eating fruit.

Others:
- leka wuko, leno kuhan talu - If Leno eats fruit, then Leno is happy.

### Context

The word leka can be used to establish any type of context for the sentences that follow:

- leka sete.nowa, Tom kuha talu - In the morning Tom ate fruit - Tom ate fruit this morning.

You may establish long and complex contexts with full sentences. You may also establish multiple contexts for one sentence.

### Mood

When using words that denote a sentiment, leka sets the mood for the following sentences. One can see them as emoji

- leka dasi, Tom kuha - Tom eats happily - Tom eats and is happy about it.
- leka nuso.dasi - I am sad - Something is sad - This has caused me sadness - Sad.

You can mix and match for more complex emotions:

- leka giyi.wawe dasi - Very sad - Sad!

## Punctuation

Tono uses a few symbols for punctuation:

- . (dot): Composes new words. Separates sentences.
- , (comma): Separates context and mood from the main sentence. Separates elements in a list.

## Elision

### Recommended

Tono may have parts of sentences elided if it is clear from context.

- leka duyo, leno kuhan - duyo, leno kuhan - Leno ate.
- leno, leka nuyu, kuhan - leno, nuyu, kuhan - Tom eats quickly.

You may remove the word "leka". This includes any usage of leka.

- leka duyo, leno kuhan - leno kuhan - Leno ate.

You may not need to specify the tense if it has been set before or it is clear in which tense you are talking about.

- leno kuhan talu - kuhan talu - Leno eats fruit.

If the subject is clear, you may elide it.

- leka vefi, talu. leka duyo, leno kuhan talu - vefi, talu. duyo, leno kuhan - The fruit? Leno ate the fruit.

If the object is clear, you may also elide it.

- leka vefi, talu. leka devo, leno kuhan talu - vefi, talu. kuhan - The fruit? Leno ate the fruit.

If a noun is clear, you may elide it and just use modifiers in the sentence.

Feel free to mix and match.

## Other languages and Tono

Tono can be mixed with other languages. You may use Tono words and grammar features in other languages. Feel free to customize them as you see fit.

### Using foreign words

Feel free to use words from other languages in Tono. For this you have two options:

1. Use it as is in the original language. This is very common for names, you may write it with the original script or you may choose to use a romanization version. For example: 日本 nokin tiwo - Nihon nokin tiwo - Japan is a country. To avoid confusion, you may set the word.
2. Transform the foreign word into Tono.

To transform a foreign word into Tono follow these rules:

1. Approximate the sounds using only Tono letters.
    - Any long sound becomes short.
    - Simplify sounds.
    - Ignore tone.
    - Follow the IPA to Tono letters map.
2. Follow the consonant-vowel rule.
3. Any sole vowel may be prepended with w.
4. Any sole consonant may be appended a u.
5. You do not need to follow the four letter rule of Tono.
6. If you feel that the process has mangled the word too much, you may set it.

Some examples:

- "GitHub": "gi" stays as is. "t" becomes "tu". "hu" stays the same. "b" becomes "bu". Finally lowercase everything: gituhubu.
- "中国": Romanized as "Zhōngguó". "son" becomes "sonu". "gua" becomes "guwa". Lowercase everything: sonuguwa

Tono does not have pronouns. Instead, you always use the name of the thing you are talking about. If you don't have enough information to form a sentence, you can use a "fene" as a placeholder.
