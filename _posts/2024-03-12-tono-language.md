## Letters

Tono uses 19 letters:

- a.
- d.
- e.
- f.
- g.
- h.
- i.
- k.
- l.
- m.
- n.
- o.
- p.
- s.
- t.
- u.
- v.
- w.
- y.

The names of the vowels are the same as the pronunciation. For the consonants add an "a":

- dada.
- fafa.
- gaga.
- haha.
- kaka.
- lala.
- mama.
- nana.
- papa.
- sasa.
- tata.
- vava.
- wawa.
- yaya.

## Pronunciation

The pronunciation is as follows, precise pronunciation is not needed:

- "a" as in map. IPA: a, ɐ.
- "d" as in dome. IPA: d.
- "e" as in level. IPA: e, ə, ɜ.
- "f" as in focus. IPA: f, ɸ, β, θ.
- "g" as in gift. IPA: g, ɢ.
- "h" as in halo. IPA: h, ɦ, x, χ.
- "i" as in meet. IPA: i.
- "k" as in ok. IPA: k, q.
- "l" as in lobotomize. IPA: l, ɭ, ɽ.
- "n" as in no. IPA: n, ɳ, ŋ.
- "o" as in no. IPA: o, ɔ, ɵ.
- "p" as in park. IPA: p.
- "s" as in tense. IPA: s, z.
- "t" as in tense. IPA: t.
- "u" as in book. IPA: u, ʉ, ɨ, y.
- "v" as in book. IPA: b, v, ʋ.
- "w" as in wet. IPA: w.
- "y" as in jet. IPA: j, ʎ, ʝ, ɟ.

Every word is stressed on the second to last syllable. Compounds are stressed on the last syllable.

For any reason, you may choose to elide the pronunciation of "w", "u", once per word (compounds are one word). You may not elide "u" if it is preceded by "w". Some examples:

- tuwo - tu'o. Elides "w".
- tuwo - t'wo. Elides "u".
- wuko - 'uko. Elides "w".
- tuwo - t'o. Incorrect, you may not elide more than once per word.
- wuko - w'ko. Incorrect, you may not elide "u" if preceded by "w".

## Sentences

The order is subject, verb, object (SVO). Let's see a simple example:

- leno kuhan kuha - Leno eats food.

Every word works as any type, the type is determined by the position in the sentence and a suffix. Verbs are marked by the suffix "n"; "kuhan" means to eat. Before the verb we have a subject which is a noun or something that works like one; in this case the name Leno. "kuha" after the verb is the object, which is a noun or something that works like a noun: "kuha" means food.

## Context and modifiers

In Tono, the verb and noun are central. Everything else is treated as a modifier. Depending on what is being modified—a whole sentence, a noun, a verb, another modifier—they are marked differently.

### Modifying nouns

To describe nouns, use any word before a noun or something that works like one:

- giyi leno - Big Leno - Leno is big.
- giyi kiku - This is big.

You can also use more than one modifier by just chaining them:

- fame giyi kiku - This is big and blue.

### Context

The word "wa" can be used to establish any type of context for the sentences that follow:

- wa setenowa, Tom kuhan talu - In the morning Tom ate fruit - Tom ate fruit this morning.

You may establish long and complex contexts with full sentences. You may also establish multiple contexts for one sentence.

### Modifiers as adverbs of verbs and sentences

The word "wa" followed by another word sets the mood of the following sentences. This can be at the start or end of the sentence, but it should always be split from the main sentence with a comma (,):

- wa nuyu, Tom kuhan - Tom eats quickly.

In the specific case of adverbs that modify the verb, they can be before the verb:

- Tom, wa nuyu, kuhan - Tom eats quickly.

Do prefer using "wa" at the start of the sentence.

### Modifiers as tense, aspect, mood of verbs

Verbs are denoted by the "n" suffix. Tense and aspect is set by using "wa" and one or more words. If the tense has been set in a previous sentence, it does not need to be set in a future sentence if it matches. For example:

- wa devo, leno kuhan. leno kuhan talu - Leno ate. Leno ate fruit.

The second sentence is also in the past with just one usage of "wa" in the first sentence. Optionally, for emphasis you may set the tense in every sentence.

#### Simple tenses

Do feel free to simplify tenses if coming from another language.

Simple present:
- wa yole, leno kuhan talu - Leno eats fruit.

Present progressive:
- wa duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno is eating fruit. 

Simple past:
- wa devo, leno kuhan talu - Leno ate fruit.

Future:
- wa vano, leno kuhan talu - Leno will eat fruit.

Imperative:
- wa pufe, leno kuhan talu - Leno, eat fruit.

#### More complex tenses

In general, prefer using simple tenses. But if needed, you may use the more complex versions.

Past progressive:
- wa devo duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno was eating fruit.

Present perfect simple:
- wa yole dopo, leno kuhan talu - Leno has eaten fruit.

Present perfect progressive:
- wa yole duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno has been eating fruit.

Past perfect simple:
- wa devo dopo, leno kuhan talu - Leno had eaten fruit.

Past perfect progressive:
- wa devo dopo duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno had been eating fruit.

Future progressive:
- wa vano duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno will be eating fruit.

Future perfect simple:
- wa vano dopo, leno kuhan talu - Leno will have eaten fruit.

Future perfect progressive:
- wa vano dopo duyo, leno kuhan talu - Leno will have been eating fruit.

Others:
- wa wuko, leno kuhan talu, wa hake, leno fenen dasi - If Leno eats fruit, then Leno is happy.

### Modifiers as prepositions

As usual, "wa" marks a modifier as a preposition. In this case, it can be used before or after the sentence, or even before or after the word being modified.

- wa nisi, leno fenen - leno, wa nisi, fenen - leno fenen, wa nisi - Leno is inside.

There are no strict possessives in Tono. To mark possession one uses the verb "suvon":

- leno, wa suvon, hamutalu - Leno's orange.

In the same vein, many relations marked by the word "of" in English are marked by "wa [verb]".

### Modifiers as conjunctions

When listing things, if the relation is obvious, not really important or left ambiguous for some reason, you may just not use a conjunction:

- leno suvon sali, tukasali - Leno has a knife and a sword.

Notice there is no "and" nor any type of context marking the relation between the two objects that are owned by Leno. This rule is followed by anything that would use conjunctions in other languages: sentences, nouns, adjectives, adverbs.

#### Coordinating conjunctions

Like many things in Tono, conjunctions are just like any other word, for joining things they are used as context and follow the same rules:

- leno suvon, wa nani, sali, tukasali - Leno has a knife and a sword.
- leno tamun, wa nane, sali, tukasali - Leno wants a knife or a sword (either one, not both).
- leno tamun, wa nano, sali, tukasali - Leno wants a knife or a sword (one, the other, or both).

### Mood

When using words that denote a sentiment, "wa" sets the mood for the following sentences. One can see them as emoji:

- wa dasi, Tom kuhan - Tom eats happily - Tom eats and is happy about it.
- wa nusodasi - I am sad - Something is sad - This has caused me sadness - Sad.

You can mix and match for more complex emotions:

- wa giyiwawe nusodasi - Very sad - Sad!

## Set words

Tono allows setting words and meanings in the middle of speech. This is useful when working with uncommon, foreign, technical words. Any pronounceable (and writable) word (or more than one) may be set. Let's see an example:

- wa toti, yutu: YouTube. leno famin yutu - Leno watches YouTube.

In a sentence like this, you are saying that "yutu" means whatever is after the colon (:). You can use any word in any language after the colon (:). You may also use full and complex descriptions in Tono. You may see it as a mini dictionary that is valid during the duration of that conversation (or text). You may set as many words you like and you may even redefine Tono words. You may also use words in any language before the colon. Useful for foreign names that use letters that are not in Tono.

## Questions

To ask a simple yes or no question, just set the question context with "wa vefi":

- wa vefi, leno tamun kuha - Leno wants food?

Notice that in Tono no question mark is needed. Some languages change the intonation or pitch when saying a question, in Tono it is not needed, but also it is not forbidden.

For open questions, "vefi" modifies other words:

- kiku fenen vefi fene - This is what entity? - What is this?
- leno tamun vefi fene - Leno wants what thing? - What does Leno want?
- leno loman vefi sali - Leno uses which knife? - Which knife does Leno use?
- leno tosen vefi wato - Leno leaves when? - When does Leno leave?
- leno fenen vefi guma - Leno is where? - Where is Leno?
- wa devo, wa vefi guma, leno diyon sali - In the past, where, Leno bought a knife? - Where did Leno buy a knife?
- wa devo, vefi huva dopon - Which human did it? - Who did it?
- wa vefi hafe, leno dopon - Which way, Leno does it? - How does Leno do it?
- wa vefi peyi, leno tamun fene - Why, Leno wants that? - Why does Leno want that?

You can always use the context version for questions. They even follow the same rules so you can add "wa vefi…" at the end of the sentence or in the middle.

## Numbers

These are the numbers:

- demo - 0.
- mahi - 1.
- mage - 2.
- weyi - 3.
- tavi - 4.
- maka - 5.
- pesi - 6.
- howe - 7.
- weke - 8.
- gema - 9.

They work like any other word in Tono; just modify a noun to establish the amount:

- leno suvon tavi sali - Leno has four knives.

Bigger numbers are read digit by digit:

- mage demo - 20.
- gema mage maka - 925.
- pesi weyi demo gema weke - 63098.

You can also use scientific notation for numbers with too many zeroes:

- mahi demo soden pesi - 10^6 - 1 000 000.

## Punctuation

Tono uses a few symbols for punctuation:

- . (dot): Separates sentences. Pronounced as a pause in speech.
- , (comma): Separates context and mood from the main sentence. Separates elements in a list. Pronounced as a short pause in speech.
- : (colon): Denotes the start of the meaning of set words. Pronounced as a short pause in speech.

## Elision

Tono may have parts of sentences elided if it is clear from context, a shorter version is required, the author or speaker may want to be ambiguous or any other reason.

- wa duyo, leno kuhan - duyo, leno kuhan - Leno ate.
- leno, wa nuyu, kuhan - leno, nuyu, kuhan - Tom eats quickly.

You may remove the marker "wa". This includes any usage of "wa".

- wa duyo, leno kuhan - leno kuhan - Leno ate.

You may not need to specify the tense.

- leno kuhan talu - kuhan talu - Leno eats fruit.

You may elide the subject.

- wa vefi, talu. wa devo, leno kuhan talu - vefi, talu. devo, leno kuhan - The fruit? Leno ate the fruit.

You may also elide the object.

- giyi talu - giyi - The big fruit.

If a noun is clear, you may elide it and just use modifiers in the sentence.

Feel free to mix and match.

## Compounds

Compound words are a way for anyone to create new words using base words from the dictionary. Compounds behave like any other word in Tono. To make a new compound: Take the main concept and put it at the end of the new word then prepend modifying words. The new word is stressed on the last syllable. Let's see some examples:

- dasi: Happiness. nuso: Opposite. nusodasi: Sadness.
- sali: Knife. tuka: Long. tukasali: Sword.

There are some concepts that work with either order on the words. In that case just choose one. When making compounds, if you feel like the concept is not fully clear, you may set it. Finally, do prefer compounds already in the dictionary over making new ones.

## Other languages and Tono

Tono can be mixed with other languages. You may use Tono words and grammar features in other languages. Feel free to customize them as you see fit.

### Using foreign words

Feel free to use words from other languages in Tono. For this you have two options.

1. Use it as is in the original language. This is very common for names, you may write it with the original script or you may choose to use a romanized version. For example: 日本 fenen tiwo - Nihon fenen tiwo - Japan is a country. To avoid confusion, you may set the word.
2. Transform the foreign word into Tono.

To transform a foreign word into Tono follow these rules:

1. Approximate the sounds using only Tono letters.
    - Any long sound becomes short.
    - Simplify sounds.
    - Ignore tone.
    - Any letter that is barely said may be elided.
    - Follow the IPA to Tono letters map.
2. Follow the consonant-vowel rule.
3. Any sole vowel may be prepended with w.
4. Any sole consonant may be appended a u.
5. You do not need to follow the four letter rule of Tono.
6. If you feel that the process has mangled the word too much, you may set it.

Some examples:

- "GitHub": "gi" stays as is. "t" becomes "tu". "hu" stays the same. "b" becomes "bu". Finally lowercase everything: gituhubu.
- "中国": Romanized as "Zhōngguó". "son" becomes "sonu". "gua" becomes "guwa". Lowercase everything: sonuguwa.

Given that this transformation relies on pronunciation and that may vary from place to place, there is no one correct transformation for words that have many variants. If one pronunciation is clearly—clearly—more used, transform that one. If not, just pick one. There can be more than one word per meaning.

## Other

### Pronouns

Tono does not have pronouns. Instead, you always use the name of the thing you are talking about. If you don't have enough information to form a sentence, you can use "fene" as a universal placeholder:

- fene fenen fame - Something is blue.

If you have some information on what could be you are talking about, for example a person, you may use a noun that describes it:

- huva tamun fene - Someone wants that (I don't know who).

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations in Tono are written in either all lowercase or the original case of the source language:

- If the abbreviation is in a foreign language, do respect the writing and pronunciation. For example, UN (United Nations) would be written in all caps and read like it is in English. Alternatively, you may read each letter using Tono, if possible: u, nana.
- If the abbreviation is in Tono, write it in all lowercase and read each letter if it does not follow the consonant-vowel rule. Otherwise, just read it like a normal word.

Feel free to set any abbreviations.

Lastly, there are no rules for building abbreviations in Tono. Feel free to build them however you like but do prefer ones that follow the consonant-vowel rule so they are easy to say.

### Verb transitivity

Every verb is both intransitive and transitive (and, if possible, with more than one object). The transitivity is the result of an object being present in the sentence:

- leno nepon - Leno dies.
- leno nepon huva - Leno kills people.

Remember that due to elision, a verb may be missing its object. In that case, it would still be transitive:

- leno nepon - Leno kills people.

For multiple transitivity use context:

- leno vefin maliwa, wa mahi vefi - Leno asks Maria one question.

### Compounds clashes

When building compound words, abbreviations, or transforming foreign words into Tono, they may end up looking the same. That's ok, words have more than one meaning. Do remember that compounds are stressed on the last syllable, pronounceable abbreviations and foreign words are stressed like any other word.

## Notes

I would like to thank the awesome [Mini language](/mini-course-grammar) and its creator S.C. Gruget for inspiring me to work on Tono.
