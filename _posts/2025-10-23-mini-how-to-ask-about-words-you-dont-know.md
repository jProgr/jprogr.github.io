# Mini: How to ask about words you don't know

These two questions are always useful when learning a new language:

- tu i dire a … e ke en mini? - How do you say … in Mini?
- … i sinifi a ke? - What does … mean?

Let's take a look at the literal translation:

- tu i dire a … e ke en mini? - You say … how in Mini?
- … i sinifi a ke? - … means what?

The first question is composed as follows:

- tu: You. Subject.
- dire: Say. This is the verb, we know that because it is marked by the particle "i".
- a …: Here you put whatever word or phrase you want to translate to Mini.
- e ke: How. This is how we make the different questions (what, where, who, etcetera).
- en mini: In Mini. This is a prepositional phrase. Usually it is marked by the particle "e", but in this case we have chosen to omit it. You can even change it to the name of another language like "en Espaniol".

You can shorten it to "tu i dire a … e ke?". Let's see how the second question is composed:

- …: The Mini term you want to know more about. Can be anything.
- sinifi: Mean. Again, this is the verb because it follows "i".
- a ke: What. This is another of the question words.

Some quick examples:

- "sera" i sinifi a ke? - What does "sera" mean?
- tu i dire a "where is the bathroom?" e ke en mini? - How do you say "where is the bathroom?" in Mini?

## Grammar

### Prepositions

They are:

- de - from, of, about, out of, made of.
- en - in, at, on.
- go - to, for, towards.
- kon - with.
- sama - like, as, than, same.

A prepositional phrase follows the thing it describes. In the case of a verb being described, it can follow the direct object.

- Tim e kon Tom - Tim is with Tom.
- mi e de México - I'm from México.
- Tom i labora en akonto-siensa - Tom works in accounting.
- da e go tu - That's for you.
- mi e sama tu - I'm like you.

### Questions

Simple yes or no questions are formed by adding a "?" or some form of confirmation with either "no?", "ja?", "u ke?" at the end:

- tu i manja a oranje? - Do you eat oranges?

For open questions one uses "ke" (what) and adds other words to make the other question words:

- tu i manja a ke? - What do you eat?
- ke man i manja a oranje - Who eats oranges?
- tu i manja e ke loke? - Where are you eating?
- si i manja en ke tempo? - When is he eating?
- tu i manja e ke rason? - Why do you eat?
- mi i debe manja a ke mui? - How much should I eat?
- si i manja e ke moda? - How does she eat?

### Compact sentences

If the meaning is clear from context, one can drop the one letter particles:

- mi i amo a tu - mi amo tu - I love you.
- i go! - go! - Go!
