# A translation of The ass and the grasshoppers by Aesop to Mini

## Tupe-kavalo an kirikiti

Uno dia, tupe-kavalo i de en kamina e en kampo an si-viro i de deteki a some kirikiti ke i de en kanti o joli e en gadi kona de kampo.

Si-viro i de ia kon mui puja a kanti de kirikiti. Si e de so joli kanti ke si-viro kore, ke i de amo a joli-neso, de-i fule kon arapan de en-i kanti sama si-ale i de kanti.

"Si a ke?" si-viro i de roga e mui venera, "ke i ave dona a so bela voka go tu-ale? tu i manja a ani besonde manja, u some deo bibe i make ke tu-ale i kan kanti e so vunda?"

"Ja", de-i dire de kirikiti, ke i favo o mui a joke; "si a gota ke mi-ale i bibe! I tenta a some an i mira".

Afa da, tupe-kavalo i da manja a nulo an i bibe o solo a gota.

Natura, pove o sili tupe-kavalo de-i mori.

Si-uno i no kan muta a jura de natura.

## The ass and the grasshoppers

One day as an Ass was walking in the pasture, he found some Grasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy corner of the field.

He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-loving heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did.

"What is it?" he asked very respectfully, "that has given you such beautiful voices? Is there any special food you eat, or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?"

"Yes," said the Grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; "it is the dew we drink! Try some and see."

So thereafter the Ass would eat nothing and drink nothing but dew.

Naturally, the poor foolish Ass soon died.

The laws of nature are unchangeable.
