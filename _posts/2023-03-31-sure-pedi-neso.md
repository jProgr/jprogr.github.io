## Sure-footedness

Sure-footedness is the ability, especially when hiking or mountain climbing, to negotiate difficult or rough terrain safely. Such situations place demands on a person's coordination and reserves of strength as well as requiring sufficient appreciation of the terrain. A person who is sure-footed is thus unlikely to slip, and will have a good head for heights when required.

On many hiking trails and mountain tours, sure-footedness is assumed to be a prerequisite without ever being defined. The term is frequently used in the literature presumably to ensure that the reader is made sufficiently aware that, under certain circumstances, one false step may lead to serious consequences.

### In animals

The term sure-footedness is also used to describe animals that routinely navigate difficult terrain, such as mountain goats. Domesticated yaks are used on climbing and trekking expeditions in the Himalayas for their sure-footed ability as pack animals. Donkeys, mules, and certain breeds of horses are also noted for their sure-footedness.
