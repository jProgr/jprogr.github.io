# Overmorrow and ereyesterday

Something that I find really curious is how some languages have words for the day after tomorrow and the day before yesterday. I thought that English did not have them. But it did, then it didn't. Currently, overmorrow (the day after tomorrow) and ereyesterday (the day before yesterday) are not in The Merriam-Webster dictionary. But they were at some point, apparently "overmorrow" was in the 1913 version[^1]. Also, there's the word "nudiustertian" (ereyesterday), coined in 1647[^2], which apparently had way more usage in written texts in ye olde times. I think they should comeback, they are pretty useful in the other languages.

Here are some in other languages that I know have words for those peculiar days:

- Esperanto: "postmorgaŭ", "antaŭhieraŭ".
- Español: Not a single word but it's of common usage and found in the RAE dictionary "pasado mañana"[^3]. For ereyesterday there are two: the most common "antier" and the old fashioned one "anteayer".
- Mini: Given that word building is part of the grammar then one could say "sige-sige-dia" and "ante-ante-dia".
- Nederlands: "overmorgen", "eergisteren".

## Notes

- Usage of the words overmorrow, ereyesterday, and nudiustertain in written texts between 1800 and 2019. One can notice that there is a new found love for them from around 2010 onwards, I'm guessing thanks to the internet [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=overmorrow%2Cereyesterday%2Cnudiustertian&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=0&case_insensitive=true](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=overmorrow%2Cereyesterday%2Cnudiustertian&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=0&case_insensitive=true).

- The word nudiustertian had a way more usage in the years following its creation but then it died down. Although it was still more used than ereyesterday [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=overmorrow%2Cereyesterday%2Cnudiustertian&year_start=1600&year_end=1800&corpus=26&smoothing=0&case_insensitive=true](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=overmorrow%2Cereyesterday%2Cnudiustertian&year_start=1600&year_end=1800&corpus=26&smoothing=0&case_insensitive=true).
