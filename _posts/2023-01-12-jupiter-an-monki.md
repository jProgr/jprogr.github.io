# A translation of Jupiter and the monkey by Aesop to Mini

## Jupiter an monki

A de demo de bebe inta animale en foreta. Jupiter i dona a gana. Ja, ale vanita feme-paren de fara an nea i de pota a si-ale bebe. Pero nulo animale i de tila o ma rano sama feme-paren monki. Vanita, si-feme i de demo a si-feme bebe inter ota karera-animale.

Sama tu i kan imaje, a de mui risa ven animale i de mira a feo, foli-nase, nulo-pelo, kabuma-oko, mini animale.

"I risa se tu i vole," de-i dire feme-paren monki. "Tamen mebi Jupiter i go dona a gana go si-viro, mi i savi ke si-viro e da ma bela, da ma suga, da ma amo amo-animale en mundo".

Feme-paren amo e nulo-mira.

## Jupiter and the monkey

There was once a baby show among the Animals in the forest. Jupiter provided the prize. Of course all the proud mammas from far and near brought their babies. But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey. Proudly she presented her baby among the other contestants.

As you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly flat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature.

"Laugh if you will," said the Mother Monkey. "Though Jupiter may not give him the prize, I know that he is the prettiest, the sweetest, the dearest darling in the world."

Mother love is blind.
