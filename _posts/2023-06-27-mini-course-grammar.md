# Mini course: Grammar

Mini is a constructed language created by S.C. Gruget. Its grammar is simple and is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. This course includes everything you need to start using the language. If at any point you feel lost, you can use the [dictionary](/buku-name) or ask around in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ajA6Z4VrkJ) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiniLang/). Let's start:

## Letters

Mini uses the following letters:

- a.
- b.
- d.
- e.
- f.
- g.
- i.
- j.
- k.
- l.
- m.
- n.
- o.
- p.
- r.
- s.
- t.
- u.
- v.

The names of the vowels are the same as its pronunciation and for the consonants just add an "e":

- be.
- de.
- fe.
- ge.
- je.
- ke.
- le.
- me.
- ne.
- pe.
- re.
- se.
- te.
- ve.

## Pronunciation

Consonants are pronounced like in English and vowels like in Spanish. Stress is always in the second to last syllable:

- "a" as in map.
- "e" as in level.
- "i" as in meet.
- "o" as in more.
- "u" as in balloon.
- "g" as gift.

For examples of pronunciation, check [buku-name](/buku-name).

## Sentences and word flexibility

Given that in Mini words can function like any other words, it uses particles to mark the role of a word in a sentence:

- i: introduces the verb.
- a: introduces direct object and noun complement.
- e: introduces adjective complement.

The order is SVO (subject, verb, object):

- mi i manja a manja - I eat food.

Here "manja" does double work thanks to the particles "i", "a". The first one is the verb "to eat" thanks to "i" and the second is the noun "food" thanks to "a".

- tu e vasa - You are wet.

"vasa" means water, but given that is being marked by the particle "e" it becomes an adjective. There is no "to be" verb, instead one uses "a", "e":

- mi a man - I am a person.
- si a viro - He is a man.
- si e viro - He is manly.
- di a kosina - This is a kitchen.
- tu i kosina e bon - You cook well.
- a man - There is a person.
- e kula - It's cool.
- tu make a manja e mala - You make the food bad.
- mi-ale i kan e sama aje - We must be the same age.
- tu i go e tu ego - You'll be on your own.

## Pronouns

There are only three:

- mi - I, me.
- tu - You.
- si - He, she, it.

To get the rest one adds words to these:

- mi-duo - we two.
- mi-ale - we (includes addressee).
- mi-mui - we (excludes addressee).
- mi-ego - myself.
- tu-ale - you all.
- tu-ego - yourself.
- si-viro - he.
- si-feme - she.
- si-kosa - it.
- si-ale - they.
- si-uno - one (indefinite pronoun).
- si-ota - the other one.
- si-ego - himself, herself, itself.

## Negation

Just prepend "no" to the thing you want to negate:

- mi i no savi - I don't understand.
- tu e no vasa - You are not wet.
- mi-ale i no pensa a da moda - That's not how we think.
- e no nese go-i dire ke si-feme e besonde piano-man - It is not necessary to say that she is an excellent pianist.

## Verbs and tense

Verbs don't specify the tense, this can be understood from context. For example this simple sentence can be in any tense:

- mi i manja - I eat - I ate - I'm eating - I will eat.

Nevertheless, if context is not enough or an explicit tense is needed one uses a multitude of words before the verb to explicitly mark it.

Simple present:
- mi i manja a oranje - I eat an orange.

Present progressive:
- mi i en manja a oranje - I am eating an orange.

Simple past:
- mi i de manja a oranje - I ate an orange.

Past progressive:
- mi i de en manja a oranje - I was eating an orange.

Present perfect simple:
- mi i ave manja a oranje - I have eaten an orange.

Present perfect progressive:
- mi i ave en manja a oranje - I have been eating an orange.

Past perfect simple:

Past perfect progressive:

Future progressive:
- mi i go en manja a oranje - I will be eating an orange.

Future perfect simple:
- mi i go ave manja a oranje - I will have eaten an orange.

Future perfect progressive:
- mi i go ave en manja a oranje - I will have been eating an orange.

Imperative:
- i manja a oranje! - Eat an orange!
- i lase tenta! - Let's try!
- i veni e ubuntu - Be kind.

Conditional:
- mi i da manja a oranje pero mi i no kan - I would eat an orange but I can't.

Optative:
- mi i arapan ke tu i manja a oranje - May you eat an orange - I hope that you eat an orange.
- i lase ke ale i manja a oranje - Let that everyone eats an orange.

Potential:

Habitual past:
- mi i pasa manja a oranje - I used to eat oranges.
- mi i pasa savi a feme - I used to know the woman.

Other examples:

- mi i debe manja a oranje - I should eat an orange.
- en-i manja a oranje e bon - Eating oranges is good.
- di oranje e de-i manja de mi - This orange is eaten by me.
- mini viro i go veni a mega viro - The small man will be a big man.
- mega viro i go e bon - The big man will be good.
- go-i ero, e man, go-i padon, e deo - To err is human, to forgive is divine.

- mini a pale de-i make - Mini is a constructed language.

- Mario i de kan ave go a ani tingi-tingi-sekola ke si-viro i de vole, pero si-viro i de eleti UConn ka si viro-paren i de go a da - Mario could have gone to any college he wanted, but he chose UConn because that’s where his dad went.
- mi i kan open a da mun go tu - I can open that door for you.

### Chaining

Notice that you can just chain verbs after the "i":

- mi i kipa en vole manja a oranje - I keep wanting to eat oranges.

## Adjectives and adverbs

For an adjective precede a noun with a word. For an adverb follow a verb with o and a word. In Mini they are just modifiers:

- mi i manja o rapi a oranje poma - I eat quickly an orange apple (the apple has the colour orange).

### Order

Like verbs, Mini allows to chain modifiers:

- mui feo bebe - Many ugly babies.

Modifiers work by altering everything to its right:

- mui feo bebe - (mui (feo bebe)).

One can introduce the particle "o" to break this altering chain and restart it:

- mui feo o bebe - ((mui feo) bebe) - Really ugly baby - Very ugly baby.

Another example:

- mui vasa kolo ropa - (mui (vasa (kolo ropa))) - (many (water (color clothes))) - many wet colorful clothes.
- mui vasa o kolo ropa - ((mui vasa) (kolo ropa)) - ((very water) (color clothes)) - very wet colorful clothes.
- mui vasa kolo o ropa - ((mui (vasa kolo)) ropa) - very water-color clothes - very blue clothes.

## Possessives

Personal pronouns used as adjectives become possessives:

- tu i manja a mi poma - You eat my apple.
- tu kaja - Your box.
- ale mi kosa - All my things.

You can also use "de", "e":

- poma de Tom - The apple of Tom.
- poma e Tom - Tom's apple.

Although the "e" form is very rare.

## Prepositions

They are:

- de - from, of, about, out of, made of.
- en - in, at, on.
- go - to, for, towards.
- kon - with.
- sama - like, as, than, same.

A prepositional phrase follows the thing it describes. In the case of a verb being described, it can follow the direct object.

- Tim e kon Tom - Tim is with Tom.
- mi e de México - I'm from México.
- Tom i labora en akonto-siensa - Tom works in accounting.
- da e go tu - That's for you.
- mi e sama tu - I'm like you.

## Questions

Simple yes or no questions are formed by adding a "?" or some form of confirmation with either "no?", "ja?", "u ke?" at the end:

- tu i manja a oranje? - Do you eat oranges?

For open questions one uses "ke" (what) and adds other words to make the other question words:

- tu i manja a ke? - What do you eat?
- ke man i manja a oranje - Who eats oranges?
- tu i manja e ke loke? - Where are you eating?
- si i manja en ke tempo? - When is he eating?
- tu i manja e ke rason? - Why do you eat?
- mi i debe manja a ke mui? - How much should I eat?
- si i manja e ke moda? - How does she eat?

## Numbers

Numbers work as adjectives and are composed from left to right:

- nulo - 0.
- uno - 1.
- duo - 2.
- san - 3.
- fo - 4.
- penta - 5.
- sita - 6
- seven - 7.
- ba - 8.
- nin - 9.
- ten - 10.
- ten nin poma - 19 apples.
- sento - 100.
- kilo - 1,000.
- duo-ten-san-ranko - 23rd.
- fo punto nulo uno - 4.01.
- duo de san peso - 2/3.
- meno fo ten duo - -42.
- penta an duo - 5 + 2.
- sita meno san - 6 - 3.
- fo de-i divi de penta - 4/5.
- fo go penta - 4^5.

## Conjunctions

They are:

- an - and.
- pero - but.
- u - or, either.

Some examples:

- mi i manja a poma an oranje - I eat an apple and an orange.
- mi i go manja a poma u oranje - I will eat an apple or an orange.
- Tom i de puse a gun-boton, pero gun i de no gun - Tom squeezed the trigger, but the gun didn't fire.

## Subordinating conjunctions

Use the words:

- ka - because.
- se - if.
- tamen - although.
- vile - while.

Some examples:

- vaku-man i kan mira a najima ka si ventana i en punto eki de tera - The spaceman can see the star because his window is pointing away from Earth.
- ka mi odi tu, mi senti sama en-i open a aero-loka - Because I hate you, I feel like opening the airlock.

If combined with "de" they make more conjunctions:

- ka de - because of.
- se de - whether.
- tamen de - despite.
- vile de - during.

Example:

- Tamen de mala manja, si i kipa go tamen a retorante - Despite the bad food, he nevertheless keeps going to the restaurant.

## Dependent clauses

Use "ke":

- mi i no savi a ale ke tu i make - I don't know everything you do.
- tu i vole manja afa ke tu i aroma a pan - You want to eat after (that) you smell the bread.
- mi e joli ke mi i de enkonte a tu - Pleased to meet you.

## Comparison

Use the following words:

- ma - more.
- meno - less.
- sama - like, as.
- bon - good.
- ma bon - better.
- da ma bon - best.
- meno bon - worse.
- da meno bon - worst.

Some examples:

- mi e sama mega sama tu - I am as big as you.
- da e ma bon - That is better.
- da pan e da ma bon - That bread is the best.
- si-uno i no nese dire ke vere-fule-neso e da ma bon ajenda - It goes without saying that honesty is the best policy.
- tu e da ma nulo-senti man ke mi i ave enkonte o ni - You're the most inconsiderate person I've ever met.

## Compound words

Given the limited vocabulary of Mini, one can create new words by composing them:

- di-dia - today.
- dimenti-neso - forgiveness.
- duo-ranko-go-fini - Second to last.

These words behave the same as any other word in Mini:

- Same pronunciation.
- Can behave like nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.

Feel free to compose as many new words as you need. The [dictionary](/buku-name) already has some that you may find useful.

## Other

### Compact sentences

If the meaning is clear from context, one can drop the one letter particles:

- mi i amo a tu - mi amo tu - I love you.
- i go! - go! - Go!

### Establish context

Notice that one can precede or end a sentence with a word to establish context:

- afa, mi-ale go - Afterward, we go.
- mi-ale debe kipa di, tamen - We should stay here, however.

### Articles

Mini lacks articles. There is no "the", "a" like in English:

- di a poma - This is an apple - This is the apple.

Which one is being used is usually clear from context. If you have multiple things and you need to talk about a specific one, you can use adjectives, position or words like "da", "di" to point to one.

### Singular and plural

Every noun in Mini is both singular and plural:

- mi i manja a poma - I eat an apple - I eat apples.

Plurality is usually clear from context, otherwise you can use number words and quantity words like "mui", "some", "meno".

### Days and months

These is how Mini talks about days of the week and months:

- dia 1 - dia-1 - Monday.
- dia 2 - dia-2 - Tuesday.
- dia 3 - dia-3 - Wednesday.
- dia 4 - dia-4 - Thursday.
- dia 5 - dia-5 - Friday.
- dia 6 - dia-6 - Saturday.
- dia 7 - dia-7 - Sunday.
- monato 1 - monato-1 - January.
- monato 2 - monato-2 - February.
- monato 3 - monato-3 - March.
- monato 4 - monato-4 - April.
- monato 5 - monato-5 - May.
- monato 6 - monato-6 - June.
- monato 7 - monato-7 - July.
- monato 8 - monato-8 - August.
- monato 9 - monato-9 - September.
- monato 10 - monato-10 - October.
- monato 11 - monato-11 - November.
- monato 12 - monato-12 - December.
- 5 de monato 12 - December 5th.

### Foreign and non-mini words

Proper nouns and foreign words can be written and pronounced as they are in their original language:

- mi i viva en Mallorca - I live in Mallorca.

Or you can choose to minify the word following this formula:

1. Prefer to use letters and ortography from Mini: America, Amerika.
2. If you can translate one or more words directly, do it: New York, Nu York.
3. If the word has a historic latin or romance-like, use that as base: Deutschland, Germania, Germania.

Then we can write:

- mi i viva en Majorka.

Pronunciation is free in this case. You can say it like in its original language or follow Mini rules (stress in the second to last syllable).

### Capitalization

On the uppercase and lowercase side, Mini can be written in two ways:

1. Maintain it simple and use lowercase everywhere. If you want to use uppercase for the first letter of a proper noun or when writting non-mini words, feel free to do it.
2. Follow the way of English and many languages: Use uppercase when starting a sentence and with proper nouns.

Both are valid Mini.

## Mini simplicity

Mini is about simplicity. You can choose to not use tenses, particles or minify words. If just saying "mi favo vere oranje" is enough to understand that you used to really like oranges, then that's valid Mini.
