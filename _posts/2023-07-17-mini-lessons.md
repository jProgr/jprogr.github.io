# Learn Mini through quizzes

The following are lessons for learning Mini through reading conversations and answering questions regarding those. Each lesson is small enough to do it in one go and after each one you can see the correct answers. They are made in Google Forms but you don't need an account. After finishing a lesson, you can click "View accuracy" to see the answers or do it again if you have any doubts.
