# Separating LEGO bricks with a piece of thread

![](/assets/images/2_brick_separators_and_thread.jpg)

When disassembling LEGO sets, there are a couple of pieces that get really stuck together. I usually use the double Brick Separator. But when there is no space for them, I get a little bit of thread and slowly slide it in between the narrow space of the bricks. Then I just pull. Sometimes they are really stuck together, in that case I use the same technique except that I use multiple pieces of thread: first I slide in a really thin one, pull a bit, then I slide another one, and so on until I have something in that can't just split apart.

For some reason, I usually have this issue with pieces [63361](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=62361#T=C) and [11477](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=11477#T=C). Once together, there is no easy way to split them apart.
