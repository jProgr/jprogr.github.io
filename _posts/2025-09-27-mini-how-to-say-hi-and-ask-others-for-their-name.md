# Mini: How to say hi and ask others for their name

Mini uses one word for salutations:

- salu - Hi - Bye.

There are also other ways to say "hi":

- bon maten - Good morning.
- bon afa-semi-dia - Good afternoon.
- bon eve - Good evening - Good night.
- bon dia - Good day.

Mini is all about simplicity, so we usually just use "salu". To ask someone their name we say

- tu name a ke? - What is your name?

Notice that translating this word by word we have "your name is what?". And we can answer:

- Tom.
- mi name a Tom - My name is Tom.

Let's see a quick conversation with these:

- Mia: salu, Leo! - Hi, Leo!
- Leo: salu. sori, tu name a ke? - Hello. Sorry, what is your name?
- Mia: e bon! mi name a Mia - It's ok! My name is Mia.
- Leo: sori, Mia. mi i dimenti o fasile a name - Sorry, Mia. I easily forget names.
