# Example Mini sentences

This is a list of translated sentences to Mini to see words used in context. The sentences come from tatoeba.org but are not directly translated there because currently the language cannot be added to the site (maybe in the future). The work is being done in a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uais6lcfFMH8g7_D5p73NxbXR1StJq1brJNnCzsswmY/edit?usp=sharing), if you would like to contribute feel free to contact me.
