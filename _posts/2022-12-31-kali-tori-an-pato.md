# A translation of A raven and a swan by Aesop to Mini

## Kali-tori an pato

Kali-tori, ke tu i savi ke si e kali sama kabon, e de envi de pato ka si-feme piuma e de bianka sama da ma pura neve. Sili kali-tori i de pensa ke se si-viro i de viva sama pato, en-i naje an dive o ale dia an en-i manja a mini-veji an veji ke develo en vasa, den si-viro piuma i da veni e bianka sama pato piuma.

Den, si-viro i de kite a si-viro domo en mui-igi an kampo an i de vola viva e en lago an fen. Pero tamen si-viro i de lava an lava o ale dia, en-i afoga o kasi a si-ego, si-viro piuma i de kipa sama kali sama tuju. An si-viro i de veni e ma naro an ma naro ka vasa mini-veji ke si-viro i de manja an, fini, si-viro i de mori.

Muta de more i go no muta a natura.

## A raven and a swan

A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the Swan's.

So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as ever. And as the water weeds he ate did not agree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died.

A change of habits will not alter nature.
