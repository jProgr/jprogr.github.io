# A translation of Hercules and the wagoner by Aesop to Mini

## Hercules an vagen-man

Nonga-man i de karo a si-viro vagen en vasa-soli jalan afa bari regen. Kavalo i de kan pota o duro a pota via dipa vasa-soli, an, fini, si i de veni a para ven uno de karo-rondo de-i afoga e tila senta de fura.

Nonga-man i de ereki de si-viro sede an de-i ereki e lado vagen, en-i mira a si-kosa pero en-i no tenta tira de fura. Si-viro i de vudu a si-viro mala-luki an i de jeritan a Hercules ka si-viro i debe veni ade. Den, si-uno i dire, Hercules i de veni, en-i dire:

"I tenta o vere, viro, an i epigo a tu kavalo. Tu i pensa ke tu i kan move a vagen via tu en-i mira o fasile a si-kosa an en-i lagrima? Hercules i go no ade no-se tu i tenta ade a tu-ego."

An ven nonga-man i de tenta o vere an i de epigo a si-viro kavalo, vagen de-i move o mui redi, an sun nonga-man i de karo e mui joli an kon etudi de-i etudi.

Ego-ade e da ma bon ade.

Selo i ade a si-ale ke i ade si-ale-ego.

## Hercules and the wagoner

A Farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut.

The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying:

"Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself."

And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.

Self help is the best help.

Heaven helps those who help themselves.
