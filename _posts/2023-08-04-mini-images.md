## Notes

- The Mini flag was chosen through voting by the community.
- The original Mini logo designed by S.C. Gruget is under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). It can also be found on the [Mini main site](https://minilanguage.com/).
- The flags, therefore, are also CC BY-SA 4.0 but by me. Feel free to use them.
