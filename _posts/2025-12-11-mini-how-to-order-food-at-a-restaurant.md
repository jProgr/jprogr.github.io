# Mini: How to order food at a restaurant

Ordering food at a restaurant is basically asking for things. And, of course, understanding what the waiter is telling you:

- di a menu - This is the menu - Here's the menu.
- tu i vole manja a ke? - What do you want to eat?
- tu e redi? - Are you ready?

Notice the second sentence. In Mini you can just chain verbs, no need for any intermediate words. They just work! Let's see another example of this by ordering something:

- mi i vole manja … - I want to eat …

You can chain together as many verbs as you want. Let's order some tacos:

- mi i vole a tako - I want tacos.
- mi i vole manja a taco - I want to eat the tacos.

Mini is a small language and it does not have the letter "c"; among others. In this case, and with any foreign word, you have two options: use it as is or minify it. If you choose to use it as is just write it or say it as it is done in the original language. Ignore any Mini pronunciation rule. If you choose to minify it then follow the following long and laborious process:

1. Change any letters to ones in Mini. Try to use letters that match the pronunciation of the word in the original language. For example, "taco" becomes "tako".

Wait, it wasn't a long process at all. For pronunciation you can either try to match the original language or follow Mini rules: stress in the second to last syllable. These minified words work the same as any other Mini word: They can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs depending on the particle that it is marking them (a, e, i, o).

Let's continue ordering food for ourselves and for an imaginary friend:

- mi i vole a tako an si i vole a niku-sando, lipo-patata an kopa de vasa - I want the tacos and he wants a hamburger, chips, and a cup of water.

Notice here instead of minifying we are directly translating and making new words with compounds:

- niku-sando - Hamburger: Some words are very common around the world, in this case we have chosen to make a new compound by taking the meaning, putting it into Mini words and joining them with a dash (-). "niku-sando" literally translates to "meat-sandwich". Feel free to make up as many compounds as you need! You can still choose to minify, instead.
- kopa de vasa - Cup of water: This is a concept made up of multiple words. We can have a cup of other things too, so here we have directly translated the whole concept.

Finally, notice how we are using "an" to join sentences and food items.

Food is its own vast world. There is no clear rule on how to translate each concept. Remember to use the dictionary before trying to do it on your own, that word may already be there. Here's a list of dishes (and beverages) to make you hungry:

- alio - Garlic.
- balo de polo - Chicken balls.

## Grammar

### Verbs and tense

Verbs don't specify the tense, this can be understood from context. For example this simple sentence can be in any tense:

- mi i manja - I eat - I ate - I'm eating - I will eat.

Nevertheless, if context is not enough or an explicit tense is needed one uses a multitude of words before the verb to explicitly mark it.

Simple present:
- mi i manja a oranje - I eat an orange.

Simple past:
- mi i de manja a oranje - I ate an orange.

Present perfect simple:
- mi i ave manja a oranje - I have eaten an orange.

Past perfect simple:
- mi i de ave manja a oranje - I had eaten an orange.

Imperative:
- i manja a oranje! - Eat an orange!
- i lase tenta! - Let's try!
- i veni e ubuntu - Be kind.

### Chaining

Notice that you can just chain verbs after the "i":

- mi i kipa en vole manja a oranje - I keep wanting to eat oranges.

### Adjectives and adverbs

For an adjective precede a noun with a word. For an adverb follow a verb with o and a word. In Mini they are just modifiers:

- mi i manja o rapi a oranje poma - I eat quickly an orange apple (the apple has the colour orange).

### Questions

Simple yes or no questions are formed by adding a "?" or some form of confirmation with either "no?", "ja?", "u ke?" at the end:

- tu i manja a oranje? - Do you eat oranges?

For open questions one uses "ke" (what) and adds other words to make the other question words:

- tu i manja a ke? - What do you eat?
- ke man i manja a oranje - Who eats oranges?
- tu i manja e ke loke? - Where are you eating?
- si i manja en ke tempo? - When is he eating?
- tu i manja e ke rason? - Why do you eat?
- mi i debe manja a ke mui? - How much should I eat?
- si i manja e ke moda? - How does she eat?

### Conjunctions

They are:

- an - and.
- pero - but.
- u - or, either.

Some examples:

- mi i manja a poma an oranje - I eat an apple and an orange.
- mi i go manja a poma u oranje - I will eat an apple or an orange.
- Tom i de puse a gun-boton, pero gun i de no gun - Tom squeezed the trigger, but the gun didn't fire.

### Dependent clauses

Use "ke":

- mi i no savi a ale ke tu i make - I don't know everything you do.
- tu i vole manja afa ke tu i aroma a pan - You want to eat after (that) you smell the bread.
- mi e joli ke mi i de enkonte a tu - Pleased to meet you.

### Compound words

Given the limited vocabulary of Mini, one can create new words by composing them:

- di-dia - today.
- dimenti-neso - forgiveness.
- duo-ranko-go-fini - Second to last.

These words behave the same as any other word in Mini:

- Same pronunciation.
- Can behave like nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.

### Singular and plural

Every noun in Mini is both singular and plural:

- mi i manja a poma - I eat an apple - I eat apples.

Plurality is usually clear from context, otherwise you can use number words and quantity words like "mui", "some", "meno".

### Foreign and non-mini words

Proper nouns and foreign words can be written and pronounced as they are in their original language:

- mi i viva en Mallorca - I live in Mallorca.

Or you can choose to minify the word following this formula:

1. Prefer to use letters and ortography from Mini: America, Amerika.
2. If you can translate one or more words directly, do it: New York, Nu York.
3. If the word has a historic latin or romance-like, use that as base: Deutschland, Germania, Germania.

Then we can write:

- mi i viva en Majorka.

Pronunciation is free in this case. You can say it like in its original language or follow Mini rules (stress in the second to last syllable).
