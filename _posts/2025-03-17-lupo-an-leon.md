# A translation of The wolf and the lion by Aesop to Mini

## Lupo an leon

Lupo i de ave robare a ovi an si i de en pota a si go si nida go-i manja a si. Pero si ajenda de-i muta e mui ven si i de enkonte a leon, ke, en-i dona a no rason, i de toma a ovi de si.

Lupo i de go a sekura fara, an den i de dire e en duka voka:

"Tu i no ave a dereko go-i toma a mi kosa sama da!"

Leon i de mira e baka, pero lupo e su fara go-e edu, si i de dire:

"Tu kosa? Tu i de kopen a si, u ovi-man i de dona a si go tu? I favo dire a mi, tu i de kapa a si e ke moda?"

Da ke si-uno i kapa o mala, si-uno i lose o mala.

## The wolf and the lion

A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.

The Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone:

"You have no right to take my property like that!"

The Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said:

"Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?"

What is evil won is evil lost.
