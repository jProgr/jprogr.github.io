# Mini: How to chat about places you want to or have visited

Do you travel a lot? Do you want to travel a lot? Which countries have you visited or even lived in? Let's start with a simple question:

- tu i favo safari? - Do you like to travel?

This question is using something called chaining in Mini. After marking the verb with the particle "i", one can just keep adding verbs without any extra markers. Both "favo" and "safari" are working as verbs in the sentence. Notice a difference if one uses a particle like "a":

- tu i favo a safari? - Do you like the trip?

Maybe we are in the middle of a trip and someone asks you this. Notice how this is not using chaining, instead it is just marking "safari" with the particle "a" as an object.

One could answer the question:

- ja, mi i favo safari - Yes, I love to travel.
- no, mi i no favo a avion - No, I don't like planes.
- ja, mi i ave visita a mui paisa - Yes, I have visited many countries.

Let's try to be more specific:

- tu i ave visita a Espania? - Have you visited Spain?

In the last two examples we are using "ave" not as a verb but as a tense marker. Mini marks tense by placing a word before the verb:

- mi i manja a oranje - I eat an orange.
- mi i en manja a oranje - I am eating an orange.
- mi i de manja a oranje - I ate an orange.

In the case of the question "tu i ave visita a Espania?" we are using the present perfect simple. Let's see some more examples:

- mi-ale i ave make a deside - We have made decisions.
- tu i ave voka a sano-karo - Have you called an ambulance?
- si-ale i ave safari - They have traveled.
- mi i ave tenta - I have tried it.
- si i ave visita a Espania - He has visited Spain.

Now, Mini is all about simplicity, so the following is correct:

- tu i ave visita a Meksiko? - Have you visited México.
- ja, mi visita Meksiko - Yes, I have visited México.

Remember, you can omit some words if the context is enough. In this case, the one responding is not adding "ave" to the verb because it is understood that they are talking about places they have visited. So, it is known that "mi visita Meksiko" is in present perfect simple. The one asking, could have also omitted the tense marker and the particles.

Let's see a conversation:

- Leo: tu i favo safari? - Do you like to travel.
- Mia: Leo? tu i vole savi a da? tu? tu i vole savi a mi? - Leo? You want to know that? You? You want to know about me?
- Leo: i reaki a roga - Answer the question.
- Mia: ja, mi i favo safari. tu i ave visita a ke paisa? - Yes, I like to travel. Which countries have you visited?
- Leo: no mui. mi i ave visita a Germania an Frans. an tu? - Not many. I have visited Germany and France. And you?
- Mia: mi i ave visita a Sbaria, Danmak, Sina, Nipon, Malta, Rusia, Turki… - I have visited Sweden, Denmark, China, Japan, Malta, Russia, Turkey…
- Leo: bon, mi i savi. tu i favo safari - Ok, I get it. You love to travel.
- Mia: ja! - Yes!
- Leo: mi i odi safari - I hate to travel.
- Mia: ke rason? pero tu i ave visita a some paisa - Why? But you have visited some countries.
- Leo: mui rason. popula, tempo, avion… - Many reasons. The people, the time, the plane…
- Mia: tu i de visita a Germania an Frans e ke rason? Why did you visit Germany and France?
- Leo: labora - Work.

## Grammar

### Negation

Just prepend "no" to the thing you want to negate:

- mi i no savi - I don't understand.
- tu e no vasa - You are not wet.
- mi-ale i no pensa a da moda - That's not how we think.

### Verbs and tense

Verbs don't specify the tense, this can be understood from context. For example this simple sentence can be in any tense:

- mi i manja - I eat - I ate - I'm eating - I will eat.

Nevertheless, if context is not enough or an explicit tense is needed one uses a multitude of words before the verb to explicitly mark it.

Simple present:
- mi i manja a oranje - I eat an orange.

Simple past:
- mi i de manja a oranje - I ate an orange.

Present perfect simple:
- mi i ave manja a oranje - I have eaten an orange.

Imperative:
- i manja a oranje! - Eat an orange!
- i lase tenta! - Let's try!
- i veni e ubuntu - Be kind.

### Chaining

Notice that you can just chain verbs after the "i":

- mi i kipa en vole manja a oranje - I keep wanting to eat oranges.

### Questions

Simple yes or no questions are formed by adding a "?" or some form of confirmation with either "no?", "ja?", "u ke?" at the end:

- tu i manja a oranje? - Do you eat oranges?

For open questions one uses "ke" (what) and adds other words to make the other question words:

- tu i manja a ke? - What do you eat?
- tu i manja e ke rason? - Why do you eat?

### Mini simplicity

Mini is about simplicity. You can choose to not use tenses, particles or minify words. If just saying "mi favo vere oranje" is enough to understand that you used to really like oranges, then that's valid Mini.
