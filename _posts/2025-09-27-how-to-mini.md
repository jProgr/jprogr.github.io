# How to Mini

The sole purpose of these lessons is to get the reader to hit the floor running with the Mini language. Mini is so easy that you can take a look at the grammar and start using the language right away with a dictionary in hand. That's it. No complex grammar structures, no exceptions nor specific cases, no convoluted rules that apply sometimes and sometimes don't. Just your ideas straight to the page (or into the ears of the one listening to you).

The lessons can be read in any order. They include all the grammar you need, audio, and exercises. If there's something you already read in another lesson, skip it. If you feel stuck, you can always check the [Mini grammar](/mini-course-grammar). I recommend starting with a [quick Mini overview](/mini).
