# A translation of The ants and the grasshopper by Aesop to Mini

## Muravi an kirikiti

Uno luse dia en tade otono, fami de muravi i de bisi en kalori sole-luse, si-ale i de en seko a sereale ke si-ale i de ave sava vile soma, ven famine kirikiti, viola unda si-viro rama, i-de veni an i de dua o umile a some manja ke si-viro i de kan manja.

"Ke!" de-i jeritan o superise de muravi, "tu i de no ave sava a ani kosa go vinta? Tu i de make a ke en mundo ale o pasa soma?"

"Mi i de no ave a tempo so ke mi i kan sava a manja," de-i lagima de kirikiti; "mi e de so bisi ka mi i de make a musika ke ante mi i de deteki, soma de-i go."

Muravi i de kanda a si-ale kanda en degu.

"Tu i de make a musika?" de-i jeritan. "Mui bon; nun, i dansa!" An i de jira a si-ale baka an i de kipa labora.

A tempo go-i labora an tempo go-i ludi.

## The ants and the grasshopper

One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.

"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"

"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the Grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone."

The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.

"Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.

There's a time for work and a time for play.
