# A translation of The father and his sons by Aesop to Mini

## Viro-paren an si fili

Viro i de ave a mui fili ke i sono-bata o tuju inta si-ale, an, tamen si-viro i de tenta, si-viro i de no kan fini-make ke si-ale i viva o tuju en pase. Den, si-viro i de deside en-savi a si-ale de si loko kon di metodo. Si-viro i de dire a si-ale ke si-ale i kapa a paketa de baton, den si-viro i de invite a kada de si-ale go-i rompe a paketa kon kolenka. Si-ale i de tenta an si-ale i de lose: an den, si-viro i de no-liga a paketa, an i de dona a baton a si-ale, uno de uno. Si-ale i de no ave a duro kon en-i rompe a si. "I mira, mi fili," si-viro i de dire, "de-i junta, tu i go e ma poten sama si-ale enemi: pero se tu i sono-bata an divi, tu-ale debile i go pone unda piti de man ke i dona-duka a tu-ale."

Junta a poten.

## The father and his sons

A certain man had several sons who were always quarreling with one another, and, try as he might, he could not get them to live together in harmony. So he determined to convince them of their folly by the following means. Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in turn to break it across his knee. All tried and all failed: and then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one, when they had no difficulty at all in breaking them. "There, my boys," said he, "united you will be more than a match for your enemies: but if you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put you at the mercy of those who attack you."

Union is strength.
